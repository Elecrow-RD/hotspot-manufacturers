## Risks & Challenges (required)
Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality and how you might address them.

The main challenge we are currently facing is the lingering issue of chip shortages from previous years. However, through our agents, we have gained insights that the chip shortage situation has been alleviated. Overall, I believe electronic components and chip shortages are obstacles faced by most hardware manufacturers. Therefore, based on our research, we will proactively stock up on key components to avoid unnecessary issues.
